## Using Static CSS, JS (w/o Less)

twitter-bootstrap-rails has seperate branch (w/o Less) that just serves latest static CSS, JS files.

You can install from latest build (from branch);

    gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails', :git => "git://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails.git", :branch => "static"

You can run bundle from command line

    bundle install


## Using stylesheets

You have to require Bootstrap CSS (bootstrap.css) in your application.css

	/*
	 *= require bootstrap
	*/

	/* Your stylesheets goes here... */

or

	/*
	 *= require bootstrap.min
	*/

	/* Your stylesheets goes here... */

## Using javascripts

You have to require Bootstrap JS (bootstrap.js) in your application.js

  //= require bootstrap

	$(document).ready(function(){
      /* Your javascripts goes here... */
	});


## Using with coffeescript
Using Twitter Bootstrap with the CoffeeScript is easy.
Just create a bootstrap.js.coffee file to /app/assets/javascripts/ folder and put lines below.

  jQuery ->
