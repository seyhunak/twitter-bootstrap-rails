# Twitter Bootstrap for Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline
Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.
It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.


twitter-bootstrap-rails project integrates Bootstrap CSS toolkit for Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline


## Installing Gem

Include Bootstrap in Gemfile;

    gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails'

or you can install from latest build;

    gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails', :git => 'http://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails.git'

You can run bundle from command line

    bundle install


## Using with Less

Bootstrap was built with Preboot, an open-source pack of mixins and variables to be used in conjunction with Less,
a CSS preprocessor for faster and easier web development.

## Using stylesheets with Less

You have to require Bootstrap LESS (bootstrap.less) in your application.css

    /*
     *= require twitter/bootstrap
    */

    /* Your stylesheets goes here... */
    

Now, you can override LESS files provided by Twitter Bootstrap

     @import "twitter/bootstrap";
     
     // Baseline grid
     @basefont:          13px;
     @baseline:          18px;


## Using Javascripts

You have to require Bootstrap JS (bootstrap.js) in your application.js

    //= require twitter/bootstrap

    $(document).ready(function(){
      /* Your javascripts goes here... */
    });


## Using With Coffeescript

Using Twitter Bootstrap with the CoffeeScript is easy.
Just create a "application.js.coffee" file to /app/assets/javascripts/ folder and put lines below.

    $ ->
	  $("body > .topbar").scrollSpy()
  	$ ->
	  $(".tabs").tabs()
	$ ->
	  $("a[rel=twipsy]").twipsy live: true
	$ ->
	  $("a[rel=popover]").popover offset: 10
	$ ->
	  $(".topbar-wrapper").dropdown()
	$ ->
	  $(".alert-message").alert()
	$ ->
	  domModal = $(".modal").modal(
		backdrop: true
		closeOnEscape: true
	  )
	  $(".open-modal").click ->
		domModal.toggle()
		

## Using Static CSS, JS (w/o Less)

twitter-bootstrap-rails has seperate branch (w/o Less) that just serves latest static CSS, JS files.

    You can install from latest build (from branch);
    
    gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails', :git => "git://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails.git", :branch => "static"
